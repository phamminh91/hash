* This repo is to record my implementation of several hashing scheme. 

* Why am I doing it?
> Because I want to be able to implement high performance data structure in C.
> And hashing seems to has lots of interesting characteristics

* What will be the outcome?
> Hopefully, it should contains several basic implementations such as linear 
> probing, quadratic probing and some other more novel ideas such as robin hood
> hashing, hopscotch hashing.

* What tools should be used?
> gcc, make, some benchmark suite
